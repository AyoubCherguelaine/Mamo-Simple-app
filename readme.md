Here's a rewritten version of the .md documentation with improved formatting and clarity:

# App Documentation

This is a small documentation to help you initialize and run this app.

## Clone from Github

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AyoubCherguelaine/Mamo-Simple-app.git
```

## Installation

First, install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the App

After installing the dependencies, you can run the app using the following command:

```bash

```

This will start the Streamlit server and open the app in your default web browser.
